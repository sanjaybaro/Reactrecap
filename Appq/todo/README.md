You are required to create a React component that fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays a list of todos. Additionally, you should implement a filter functionality that allows users to filter the todos based on their completion status.
Requirements:
API Endpoint: Utilize the JSONPlaceholder API at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos.
Fetch all todos from the API endpoint and display them in a list format.
Each todo item should include details such as the todo's title and completion status.
Implement a checkbox or select dropdown to enable filtering options based on completion status.
Provide two filtering options: completed and incomplete.
When the user selects a filtering option, update the todo list to show only the todos that match the selected status.
Handle loading and error states appropriately.
Use modern React practices and best practices for fetching data.
